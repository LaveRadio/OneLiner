# OneLiner
I wrote this for when I'm streaming. takes a nice long list, and spews out ONE line at random to a pre-defined text file for OBS to read.

Load an input file, select an output file, configure the delay, click start.

A single random line will be written to the output file for OBS to read. It's really not that hard.

Oh yeah, if the app is in RUN state, the FILE menu is disabled. lazy way of avoiding issues.
